    <P>Hello everyone. I'm from Brazil, originaly from the city of Ponta Grossa in the state of Parana, but now I live in Maringa which is in the same state.</P>
    <p>I moved 2 years ago, started living by myself and working at a starting company. Here I met my wife and we've been married for 7 months now.</p>
    <p>My plans for education are to get a degree and develop skills in programming so I can have a carrer in this field and be able to better provide for my family.</p>
    <p>I've always had an interest in technology and since I got back from a full-time mission in the Utah Salt Lake City Mission, I always wanted to pursue something that would allow me to use my english skill often. This course feels like a good combination for that. Also having the oportunity to work from home eventually is a big plus for me.</p>
