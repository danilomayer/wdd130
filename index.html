        <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am Danilo Mayer, a Collections Supervisor passionate about web development and innovation. I work
            in the financial sector, managing collections teams and ensuring success in the recovery of funds. My
            interest in web development drives me to explore how technology can enhance business operations and
            streamline processes within the industry.
            <br>
            ðŸŽ“ Currently, I am studying Applied Technology at Brigham Young University - Idaho, where I focus on web
            development to optimize processes and drive efficiency. This academic journey provides me with a unique
            perspective on implementing web-based solutions to solve real-world problems. I am always open to connecting
            and collaborating with professionals in the financial, technology, and web development fields. If you share
            interests in these areas or are interested in discussing collaboration opportunities, I would be happy to
            connect.

        <p>ParanÃ¡ is a state in southern Brazil thatâ€™s home to IguaÃ§u Falls, with hundreds of cascades straddling the
            border with Argentina. Surrounding the falls is IguaÃ§u National Park, a subtropical rainforest with diverse
            wildlife, while north lies the massive Itaipu Dam. Hundreds of kilometers east, close to the Atlantic
            beaches of Guaratuba and the large port of ParanaguÃ¡, is the leafy state capital, Curitiba. â€• Google</p>
