                <p>Hello visitor, this is I am Danilo Mayer and this is my page ðŸ˜Š</p>
                <p>This is a space is that I show people my web development projects and the skills that I`m learning right now.
                    The main goal for this page is for everyone to have a first sight of what my capabilities will be like and then as I make progress on this career, learn more and participate in more projects, I will be updating this page to show what I have accomplished.</p>

            <section class="journey">
                <h2 class="journey_title">MY JOURNEY</h2>
                <p>I would say I have started learning about I.T. and Computer Programming in 2020, but it was a slow process for me, of discovering how this field is so fascinating to me and discovering my passion for development. I only took a few introductory classes that year, on late 2021 I decided that I would dive in completely into this world and started taking university classes web development. And here I am right now, it is only the beginning of my story and there is A LOT that I will still accomplish as a developer.</p>

                <h2 class="plans_title">MY PLANS</h2>
                <p>I intend to be graduating latest 2028 from BYU-Idaho with a Bachelors in Applied Technology and another Bachelors in Computer Science from Decomplica Faculty. Meanwhile I plan on getting micro certificates from both universities and participating in various projects to gain real world experience and getting ready to enter this market as a professional with excellence.</p>
                <p>So, with this purpose I make this page and I hope you enjoy your visit!</p>
