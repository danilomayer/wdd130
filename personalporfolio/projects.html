                    <h3>TIDEGLOW Whitewater Rafting page</h3>
                    <p>This is the first site plan that I have done with the help of my college class. It is for a Whitewater Rafting fictional company. I haven`t done entirely myself this site plan because the structure and some information were already there but I have created the logo and name of the company alone, and chosen the palette for the site.</p>

                    <p>This one I was more left alone to create, with only the content and images given to me, I had to make the HTML and CSS of this page and also created the wireframe that is on the site plan above.</p>

                <p>This website itself is my second web project. I am doing this one from scratch and as it develops and as I am able to present something to you be sure that I will be putting it here.</p>
                <p>Other than that, from my coding experience I have taken basic classes on Python and JavaScript.</p>
