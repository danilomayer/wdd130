      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I will make a website that showcases my web development projects and will be a place where I will show the skills that I`m learning right now. It will be sort of an expansion of the About Me post from week 1 with room for more details and more technical information. Also, an area with my contact and ways to reach me. My main goal with this course is to become a professional in technology and this project will be a way of presenting my work to possible future employers.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This project is intended mainly to be a presentation to future employers and to show anyone interested in my work what my skills and accomplishments are. I also think it will be a good way for me to keep track and maintain my work in a single webpage</p>  <!-- change this -->

          INTRODUCTION<br>
        Hello visitor, this is I am Danilo Mayer and this is my page üòä<br>
        [Picture of myself on a suit. Gotta be presentable.]<br>

        This is a space is that I show people my web development projects and the skills that I`m learning right now.<br>
        The main goal for this page is for everyone to have a first sight of what my capabilities will be like and then as I make progress on this career, learn more and participate in more projects, I will be updating this page to show what I have accomplished.<br>
        <br>
      	  MY JOURNEY<br>
        I would say I have started learning about I.T. and Computer Programming in 2020, but it was a slow process for me, of discovering how this field is so fascinating to me and discovering my passion for development. I only took a few introductory classes that year, on late 2021 I decided that I would dive in completely into this world and started taking university classes web development. And here I am right now, it is only the beginning of my story and there is A LOT that I will still accomplish as a developer.  <br>
        <br>
        	MY PLANS<br>
        I intend to be graduating latest 2028 from BYU-Idaho with a Bachelors in Applied Technology and another Bachelors in Computer Science from Decomplica Faculty. Meanwhile I plan on getting micro certificates from both universities and participating in various projects to gain real world experience and getting ready to enter this market as a professional with excellence.<br> 
        <br>
        So, with this purpose I make this page and I hope you enjoy your visit!

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Here are the projects that I have already done. (Be certain that in a near future I will have a lot more to show üòä)<br>

	      TIDEGLOW Whitewater Rafting page<br>
        [Screenshot of the W.W.R. site plan or link for the page]<br>
        This is the first site plan that I have done with the help of my college class. It is for a Whitewater Rafting fictional company. I haven`t done entirely myself this site plan because the structure and some information were already there but I have created the logo and name of the company alone, and chosen the palette for the site. <br>
        [Screenshot of home page for W.W.R. site or link for the page]<br>
        This is the home page for the Whitewater Rafting fictional site that I have called Tide Glow. With the help of my college class, I have created the HTML and CSS for this page formatting in a way that will be user friendly for both web and mobile.<br>
        <br>
        [Screenshot of the Page 2 W.W.R. site, the ‚ÄúRivers‚Äù page or link for the page]<br>
        This one I was more left alone to create, with only the content and images given to me, I had to make the HTML and CSS of this page and also created the wireframe that is on the site plan above. <br>
        <br>
        This website itself is my second web project. I am doing this one from scratch and as it develops and as I am able to present something to you be sure that I will be putting it here.<br>
        <br>
        Other than that, from my coding experience I have taken basic classes on Python and JavaScript.<br>
        <br>
        Stay tuned because there is much more to come‚Ä¶
